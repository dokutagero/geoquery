Internal Notes

* Information about virtualenv/virtualenvwrapper:

https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html

It is extremely simple to understand and very handy. Basically creates an isolated
python environment. I can contain packages installed via pip which will make
our project not to make conflits with our system software/versions.

* Pycharm
https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/
I would suggest to use a IDE for developing this particular project in Python.
There is a free version which is very complete. We have autocomplete and many
other features that could come in hand.
